# Stardew Knockoff ⭐️
This is a pixelated 2D python game with the same gameplay as Stardew Valley
She's not perfect but she is a good baseline for pygames! 

# How to run
- Make sure pygame, pytmx are installed
- cd into code, make a virtual environment, and run main.py
- Use WASD keys to navigate, tab key to change selection, and click to use tool / seed, and spacebar to sleep
